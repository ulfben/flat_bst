# Build and IDE directories
# These directories contain compiled outputs, intermediate files, and IDE-specific 
# settings. They can be regenerated from source code, so there's no need to version 
# control them. Including them would bloat the repository and cause merge conflicts.

# Compiled files
# Binary and intermediate compilation files that are generated during the build process.
# These should never be version controlled as they:
# 1. Are platform-specific and should be built for the target environment
# 2. Can be recreated from source code
# 3. Would cause unnecessary conflicts in version control

*.lib     # Static libraries
*.dll     # Dynamic-link libraries

# Visual Studio files

# Temporary files
# Files created during development that are not needed for the build process.
# These are usually debug logs, editor temporary files, and IDE caches.

# Test Results
# Output from running tests - these should be generated on demand and not stored
# in version control, as they'll differ between machines and test runs.

# Keep vendor files
# Exception to allow committing third-party dependencies in the vendor directory.
# This can be useful when you want to:
# 1. Ensure specific versions of dependencies are always available
# 2. Make builds reproducible without external package managers
# 3. Protect against upstream package deletions
